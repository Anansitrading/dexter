# Dexter ðŸ¤–

An autonomous financial research agent that performs deep analysis using task planning, introspection, and real-time market data. Inspired by Claude Code, but built specifically for financial research.

## Overview

Dexter breaks down complex financial queries into actionable tasks, executes them intelligently using real-time data APIs, and synthesizes comprehensive, data-driven answers. Unlike simple chatbots, Dexter plans ahead, validates its progress, and iterates until it gathers the information needed to thoroughly answer your questions.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Task Planning**: Automatically decomposes complex queries into structured research steps
- **Autonomous Execution**: Selects and executes the right tools to gather financial data
- **Self-Validation**: Checks its own work and iterates until tasks are complete
- **Real-Time Financial Data**: Access to income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements
- **Safety Features**: Built-in loop detection and step limits to prevent runaway execution

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- OpenAI API key
- Financial Datasets API key (get one at [financialdatasets.ai](https://financialdatasets.ai))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd dexter
```

2. Install dependencies with uv:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
# FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

### Usage

Run Dexter in interactive mode:
```bash
uv run dexter-agent
```

### Example Queries

Try asking Dexter questions like:
- "What was Apple's revenue growth over the last 4 quarters?"
- "Compare Microsoft and Google's operating margins for 2023"
- "Analyze Tesla's cash flow trends over the past year"
- "What is Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio based on recent financials?"

Dexter will automatically:
1. Break down your question into research tasks
2. Fetch the necessary financial data
3. Perform calculations and analysis
4. Provide a comprehensive, data-rich answer

## Architecture

Dexter uses a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:

- **Planning Agent**: Analyzes queries and creates structured task lists
- **Action Agent**: Selects appropriate tools and executes research steps
- **Validation Agent**: Verifies task completion and data sufficiency
- **Answer Agent**: Synthesizes findings into comprehensive responses

## Configuration

Dexter supports configuration via the `Agent` class initialization:

```python
from dexter.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(
    max_steps=20,              # Global safety limit
    max_steps_per_task=5       # Per-task iteration limit
)
```
